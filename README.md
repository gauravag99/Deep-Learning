# Deep-Learning
These are assignments I completed while going through a Deep Learning Specialization course on Coursera offered by deeplearning.ai by Andrew Ng.
These files are supposed to be here for my own reference, please refrain from copying. I would not be responsibel for your loss, if any.

The course structure is:
## Course 1:
Regular plain deep neural networks
## Course 2:
Hyperparameter tuning and training efficiency, intro to Tensorflow.
## Course 3:
Structuring machine learning projects (no code, hence no file uploaded).
## Course 4:
Convolutional neural nets, Tensorflow and Keras.
