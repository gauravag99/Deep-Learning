# Deep-Learning
These are assignments I completed while going through a Deep Learning Specialization course on Coursera offered by deeplearning.ai by Andrew Ng.
These files are supposed to be here for my own reference, please refrain from copying. I would not be responsibel for your loss, if any.

The course structure is:

## Course 1:
Regular plain deep neural networks, contains:

  * Logistic Regression as a Neural Network
  * Planar data classification with one layer NN
  * Handwritten digit recognition and classification
  * Other image recognition

## Course 2:
Hyperparameter tuning and training efficiency, intro to Tensorflow. Contains:

* Gradient Checking
* Initialization
* Regularization
* Optimization Methods
* Tensorflow NNs and intro

## Course 3:
Structuring machine learning projects (no code, hence no file uploaded).

## Course 4:
Convolutional neural nets, Tensorflow and Keras. Conatins:

* Convolutional models
* Keras intro and simple models
* Resnets
* Car Detection in Images (YOLO v2 algorithm)
* Face Recognition
* Neural Style transfer
